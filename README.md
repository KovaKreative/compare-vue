# compare-vue

> A simple Vue landing page built as an experiment to compare to the process of building three identical web pages using Vue, React, and Angular.

All three projects can be found here:
[Compare Vue](https://github.com/KovaKreative/compare-vue)
[Compare React](https://github.com/KovaKreative/compare-react)
[Compare Angular](https://github.com/KovaKreative/compare-angular)

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
